# Portfolio!
personal portfolio website!
One of the most straightforward yet challenging front-end projects I made is building a personal site. I started it as my resume. This means I can add information about my experience, skills, and expertise on the website as a Freelance web designer and developer, I should tend to have a beautiful personal site for this purpose. 

I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep the website engaging, unique, and interactive.
